### üöÄ Work Trial Requirements for Senior Fullstack Engineer

#### üõ†Ô∏è Task 1: REST API Development

**Objective:**

- Develop a REST API using Node.js and Express that simulates data integration and management for a hypothetical operational tool. The API should unify data from platforms like Slack and Jira into a single interface to visualize overlapping patterns between connected tools. Implement PostgreSQL to store and manage the integrated data. The scope can be limited but should showcase a thoughtful approach to integrating disparate data sources and handling data persistence.

**What to Turn In:**

- **Code and Documentation:** Source code for the API with clear, well-commented logic. Provide documentation with setup instructions, API endpoints description (Swagger or similar), data schema diagram, and how it interacts with the PostgreSQL database.
- **Testing:** Include unit and integration tests demonstrating the API's functionality and robustness, particularly its interactions with the database.

#### üîß Task 2: React Dashboard Implementation

**Objective:**

- Create a dynamic dashboard using React and TypeScript that interacts with the API developed in Task 1. The dashboard should allow users to visualize and analyze data patterns from connected tools.
- Utilize React context or Redux for state management and Tailwind CSS for styling.

**What to Turn In:**

- **React Application Code:** Complete source code for the dashboard, including state management and API interactions.
- **UI/UX Documentation:** Document detailing the component structure, state management, and user flow.

#### üåê Task 3: CI/CD and Deployment

**Objective:**

- Implement a CI/CD pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys the API and React dashboard from Task 1 and Task 2 to a Dockerized environment on an AWS EC2 instance. 
- Utilize GitHub Actions for automated builds and testing.

**What to Turn In:**

- **CI/CD Pipeline Code:** GitHub Action YAML file(s) with steps for automated build, test, and deployment.
- **Docker Configuration:** Dockerfile(s) and other necessary configuration files for containerizing the API and dashboard.
- **Deployment Documentation:** Clear guide explaining the setup of the Dockerized EC2 environment, and how to maintain the deployment.

### üìä Evaluation Criteria

- **Technical Proficiency:** Effectiveness in building and integrating systems using the specified tech stack (Node.js, React, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, AWS).
- **Innovation and Practical Application:** Creativity in API design and dashboard UI implementation.
- **Documentation and Clarity:** Quality of written materials, including code comments and setup guides.
- **Adaptability to New Technologies:** Demonstrated capability to utilize modern development practices and tools.
