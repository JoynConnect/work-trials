## 🚀  Work Trial Requirements for Lead Backend Engineer (Data)

### 🛠️ Task 1: Design a Simplified Data Pipeline
**Let's get started:**
- Your challenge is to create a basic but scalable data pipeline using AWS services to process and store data from a single source into PostgreSQL.
- Think about scalability: Outline how this setup could be expanded, including the integration of vector databases for advanced needs.

**What to turn in:**
- 📄 A simple architecture diagram to show us your design.
- 📝 A one-page write-up explaining your choice of AWS services and how the system could be scaled.

### 🧹 Task 2: Prototype for Data Cleaning and Contextual Analysis
**Here’s what to do:**
- Whip up a Python script to simulate extracting, cleaning, and performing a basic contextual analysis of provided sample data (see `dataGen` folder).
- Make sure your script is robust by including error handling and data validation.

**What to turn in:**
- 💻 Python code with clear comments.
- 📃 A README that guides us through your script operations and the flow of data.

### 🤖 Task 3: ML/AI Data Infrastructure Outline
**Your task:**
- Draft a succinct proposal outlining an efficient backend setup for feeding data into ML/AI models, focusing on performance and data integrity.

**What to turn in:**
- 📑 A 2-3 page proposal highlighting your infrastructure plan, data flow, and choice of technology stack.

### 🔍 Task 4: Quick Implementation Using Langchain
**Challenge time:**
- Show us a quick implementation using Langchain to boost a particular aspect of your data pipeline, emphasizing how it can generate insights or aid data operations.

**What to turn in:**
- 🖥️ Source code for your implementation.
- 📘 A short guide or document explaining the benefits and application of Langchain in your proposed setup.

## 📊 Evaluation Criteria
- **Technical proficiency:** We’re looking for efficiency and effectiveness in your solutions.
- **Architecture and scaling:** Your understanding of scalable systems and how they might integrate is key.
- **Documentation and clarity:** Impress us with the quality of your written materials and code commentary.
- **Innovation and practical application:** Your use of Langchain and how you adapt it to the tasks will be crucial.
